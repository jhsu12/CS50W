## General info
Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

## Technologies


- HTML
- CSS

## Specification
- **Pages**<br/>
Your website should have at least three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
- **Query Text**<br/>
On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
- **Query Images**<br/>
On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
- **Query Advanced**<br/>
On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
    - Find pages with… “all these words:”
    - Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
    - Find pages with… “any of these words:”
    - Find pages with… “none of these words:”
- **Appearance**<br/>
Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.
- **Lucky**<br/>
Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
- **Aesthetics**<br/>
The CSS you write should match Google’s own aesthetics as best as possible.
